They said thank you and tears began running down their faces.  They suddenly left the room and returned with 17 ak47's  and 12 pipe bombs which they handed over to me.  They declared that Jihad is no longer necessary and they wish to live in peace now.  I think we should buy these Hutzler 571 Banana Slicers and send them to Syria and Iraq and just watch the peace break out.","rating":5,"author":"Kate A.

Everything was going smoothly until the brilliant cutting action cut into my leg as i was dancing! Sweat poured in and i blacked out. I ended up thinking jimmy hoffa became president and that he wanted to breed sharks to help the U.S gain power in the middle east. None of this made sense until i came round.
