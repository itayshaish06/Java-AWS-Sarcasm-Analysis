In fact it is so great that the legendary Woody Hayes used this product to slice his nanners for his Buckeyes as the won national title after national title. rumor has it, his assistant coach bo schumsuckler was so opposed to the awesomeness that was the Hutzler 571 he left the storied collegiate powerhouse that is The Ohio State University and headed north to university of something. without the greatness that is the Hutzler 571 Slicer by his side and in the locker room, his streak of national titles he won with Buckeyes came to a screeching halt and he never won a national championship again. oh, and up yours Robert Marienfeld.

It isn't so sharp that children would get hurt by it. I use this to slice bananas for my kids.
